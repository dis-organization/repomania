Nothing to see yet. 

TODO

general read function, needs to handle
 - different products, product options
 - single time per file
 - multi-time per file
 - mulit-attributes per file / band

ensure \dots always passed to brick() so we can use filename
- need to make each data source native to raster (or similar) so that
stack() can take a list of file names, or no-cost version

extract#function,data.frame has to work for no-time-dimension
